    These features will slowly come alive, hopefully, over the course of my 4-year college courses. Feel free to download and modify the code at your leisure, but please do not claim ownership of content that isn't yours or attempt to derive monetary value from it. If you wish to be part of the project, you can contact me at any time using the email address provided on my account or my personal email at @thephantomone88@gmail.com. 

# Some Background About Myself
    I am a primarily self-taught student in Computer Programming. I learned about it from the age of six and gradually applied the skills I learned to my day-to-day activities, deciding from a young age that computer programming was where I wanted to be. Now that I am in my 4-year college, I am happily expanding my knowledge of the languages I already know, such as Python, C++, C#, and adding to that, learning about Git, COBOL, basic Java functionality, Swift (the iOS version of Python), and more. I absolutely love it. 

    I am generally available most of the time, from around 2 pm to 10 pm EST, if you'd like to chat on Discord or via email and debug some code. I love learning new languages. As I mentioned in my college career, I have already expanded my knowledge to some general basics of various programs. However, I know there are many more, and I want to learn as many as I can, preferably becoming proficient in all of them. 


# How to run the Game
    1. You must have Python installed on your system

    2. run pip in CMD(command prompt) to see if it installed properly

    3. Unzip the folder

    4. Go to your directory (CD) command on Windows to the folder

    5. Then use the pip install -r requirements.txt file provided, which will give you all the assets used in this project.

    6. After you make sure everything is installed correctly using pip list (this will show you all packages downloaded using PYPI Library, where Python stores all its content.)

    7. Double-click the main.py file or right-mouse-click and click open. If you have a text editor like Visual Studio Code or a similar tool, I would open the file or the entire folder in it and then run it, as this can sometimes resolve issues that are known to occur.
